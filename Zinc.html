	<b> What is Zinc? </b>
Zinc is a mineral that is essential for many of the body's normal functions and systems, including:
<ul>
<li>the immune system</li>
<li>wound healing</li>
<li>blood clotting</li>
<li>thyroid function</li>
<li>senses of taste and smell</li>
</ul>
Zinc also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood and adolescence.
</p>

<b> Why is it Important? </b>
<p>
The body cannot make zinc, so you need to get it from the food you eat. It is mainly stored in the muscle and bone.<br/>
Zinc is important for many of the body's functions:<br/>
Immune system: The body needs zinc to fight off infection. People who don't have enough zinc in their body may be at greater risk of infections. Children and older people are at greater risk.<br/>
Wound healing: Zinc supports skin health. If you don't have enough zinc in your diet, it can lead to skin changes that can look like eczema at first. Zinc supplements may be used to help people who have burns or leg ulcers that heal very slowly or don't heal.<br/>
Taste and smell: Zinc is very important for one of the enzymes you need so that you are able to taste and smell.<br/>
</p>

<b> Where can we find Zinc? </b>
<p>
Zinc is found in many foods including:
<ul>
<li>meat</li>
<li>fish and seafood</li>
<li>poultry</li>
<li>cereals and whole grains</li>
<li>nuts, seeds and legumes</li>
<li>dairy foods</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The amount of zinc the body can absorb is affected by how much protein is in the diet. Zinc tends to be better absorbed from animal-based foods than plant-based foods. This means that vegetarians and vegans, or people on long-term restricted diets, are more likely to experience zinc deficiency.
Some people may need more zinc than they can get from food alone. Zinc can be found in zinc supplements or multivitamin supplements and cold remedies that contain zinc.
