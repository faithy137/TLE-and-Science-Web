	<b> What is Nitrogen? </b>
<p>

</p>
<b> Why is it Important? </b>
<ul>
<li>It is used to make amino acids in our body which in turn make proteins.</li>
<li>It is used in the production of fertilizers, nitric acid, nylon, dyes and explosives.</li>
<li>Nitrogen gas is also used to provide a nonreactive atmosphere.</li>
<li>It is used in this way to preserve foods, and in the electronics industry during the production of transistors and diodes.</li>
<li>Liquid nitrogen is often used as a refrigerant. It is used for storing sperm, eggs and other cells for medical research and reproductive technology. </li>
</ul>
<b> Where can we find Nitrogen? </b>
<p>
The largest reservoir of nitrogen is found in the atmosphere, mostly as nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrogen gas makes up 78% of the air we breathe. Nitrogen moves slowly through the cycle and is stored in reservoirs such as the atmosphere, living organisms, soils, and oceans along the way. 
</p>
<b> How do we use Nitrogen? </b>
<ol>
<li>Nitrogen gas is used to provide an unreactive atmosphere hence it preserves foods from degradation.</li>
<li>Nitrogen is used to reduce fire hazards in some aircraft fuel systems.</li>
<li>Nitrogen is also important to the chemical industry. It is used in the production of fertilizers, nitric acid, nylon, dyes and explosives.</li>
<li>Nitrogen is used for filling in light bulbs since it is a non-reactive gas.</li>
<li>In the pharmaceutical industry, nitrogen is frequently used to move a reaction mixture from one vessel to another.</li>
